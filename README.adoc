== Requirements

-  Allow MVC and component style web development in pure Java
-  No HTML, CSS, JSP, XML or properties files
-  Provide libraries for pure Java representation of HTML and CSS
-  Templating in Java (methods, inheritance, parametrization)
-  Validation as part of the domain model classes
-  Limit the use of annotations and reflection
-  Use interfaces and immutable objects wherever possible
-  Localization using L10n registry, lookup in Java
-  Page navigation rules in pure Java
-  Pluggable URL routing (with resource based approach as default)
-  Transparent conversion of HTTP params to model objects
-  By default each "webapp" runs in separate JVM using embedded HTTP engine
-  Utilize a high performance HTTP engine like Undertow
-  Future: Deployable as WAR to standard web containers like Tomcat
-  TBD: JavaScript / Ajax support
